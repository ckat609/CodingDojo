        <h1>Growing Pains</h1>
        <img src="img/3d.jpg" alt="3d.jpg">
        <p>If you don't like hard work, if you don't like long hours, if you don't have patience - in other words - if you don't like to fail, leave now and never come back!  However, if you feel passionate about pretty pictures and bringing them to life, keep on reading... I might just end up motivating you to do one of the most rewarding things you'll ever do in your life!</p>
        <p>Computer graphics, like many other art forms, requires a lot of dedication.  Don't expect to be a 3D ninja after just one week of work.  It will take months to sort of get it, and years to master it.</p>
        <p>It took me many attempts to finally get it - eight to be exact - in the span of nearly 20 years.  I would get excited, sit in front of the computer, work on something and then, after a couple of weeks, I would get frustrated.  I'm not sure what happened on the eigth attempt, but that was when it clicked... just like that.  After that happened, I felt like I could do anything.  After a few short weeks, I was making awesome images.  I started interacting with people on forums, asking questions on live streams, asking for feedback and, when I started feeling confident, even entering contests.  It was at this point that I started getting better almost on a daily basis.  Why, you ask?  Well, because asking something and being labeled a noob is hard.  Getting critiqued by someone else who's not your mom is tough.  Entering a contest and not even getting an "honorable mention" is not cool.  This, however, is what makes us improve because it makes us realize we can do better.</p>
        <p>What I learned from 3D was that I had to fail many times to get better at it.  I'm nowhere near to being a master, but I am good at it.  The journey has been tough, but it has been a lot of fun!</p>
